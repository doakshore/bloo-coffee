Welcome to Bloo Coffee, where your voice matters! Our website, built with the powerful Flask framework, allows you to vote for your favorite coffee flavor with just a few clicks. Our application uses SQLite as a reliable database management system and the Jinja2 templating engine to create visually appealing HTML templates.

Our project consists of various parts and features that make it unique and intuitive. The app.py file is the main file that defines the different web pages and their functionality, depending on what the user needs. Each page is designed using different templates that provide a seamless user experience. Our templates include index.html, which is the homepage of our website, base.html, which provides the basic structure and style that all pages share, about.html, which tells the story of our company, and vote.html, where users can submit their vote with ease.

As administrators, you have the ability to manage data in the database using admin.html. You can add new administrators to the database using newadmin.html and new flavors to the database using newflavor.html. Login to our website using login.html to access all these features and more!

Our project is built on a Flask web application that serves several routes. It uses SQLite as its database management system and the Jinja2 templating engine to render HTML templates. We've also included a range of libraries and modules to enhance the user experience, including import statements, session management, URL routes, redirecting functions, and much more.

We take the security of our users seriously, which is why we've included password hashing and verification functionality using werkzeug.security and email validation using validate_email.

In summary, Bloo Coffee is a user-friendly web application that allows users to vote for their favorite coffee flavor and administrators to manage the database. Our sleek and stylish templates, combined with our reliable framework, create a seamless user experience that will keep you coming back for more. So why wait? Cast your vote now and join the Bloo Coffee community!
